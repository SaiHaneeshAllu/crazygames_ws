==========

In this project we implement pursuit-evasion games between multiple agents on the Crazyflie platorm. The implementation of the  controllers is based on ROS, building on the work done [here](https://github.com/whoenig/crazyflie_ros)

Features:
* Leader-Follower 
* Formation flight with multiple agents
* [Time-optimal control](https://youtu.be/RUD8US8enEw)
* [Basic pursuit-evasion games](https://youtu.be/VzRvcAKm9YA)

This is a work in progress and the technical details will be updated soon.
